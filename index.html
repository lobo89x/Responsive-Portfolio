      <img src="assets/images/0.jpg" class="auth-image" alt="Alexander Lee">

      <p>Born to humble beginnings, Alexander has come a long way. After earning his Bachelorâ€™s of Science in Physics, he went to work for a small tech company where he learned he had a knack for learning many tools at once. After a few years he realized he wanted to make the tools not just learn them. He took a few detours but is now at the latest chapter of his journey and is still learning all he can.</p>

      <p>A boarn leader, ALexander gravitated to using his mind rather than his brawn to prove himself in life.</p>

      <img src="assets/images/0.jpg" class="auth-image" alt="Alexander Lee">

      <p>Born to humble beginnings, I have come a long way. After earning my Bachelors of Science in Physics, I went to work for a small tech company where I learned of my knack for learning many tools at once. After a few years I realized I wanted to make the tools not just learn to use them. I now find myself at the latest chapter of this journey and am still learning all I can.</p>
      <p>The Ga Tech Coding boot camp helped me focus my desire and intentions to help me build a new skill set. While I basked in the well balanced wealth of knowledge the camp offered, I came to prefer back end development. I became skilled at things like React, Express and JavaScript. I learned that my work experiences had helped me forge tools that the camp helped me sharpen. I would use my skills in team dynamics and debugging to great success in much of my time there. By the end of the course, I found I had gained a bunch of new skills and prowess as well as a hunger to learn more.</p>
      <p>Now that I have completed my Full Stack Web Development Coding Certification from GaTech, I aim to bring this skillset to a new arena and further sharpen my front end and back end skills in MYSQL, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React and Angular just to name a few. I am continuing to hone my craft by sharpening my skill with code reviews, problems solving, web design and discovering newer languages and techniques. I hope to bring my skills and more to an organization and prove myself a great asset while building on my current abilities.</p>
